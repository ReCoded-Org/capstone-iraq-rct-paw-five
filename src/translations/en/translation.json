Do her a favor and provide a small area to  call her own for the first few days or weeks. A bathroom or laundry room works well. Furnish the room with cat amenities, such as food, water and a litter box. You’ll want to spend time with your  cat, so make sure there’s a comfortable place for you to sit as well.  ",
    "text2": "2- Fill a litter box with one or two inches of litter and place it in her room where she can use it undisturbed. After all, everyone deserves a modicum of privacy when pottying!    ",
    "text3": "3- Set up a feeding station with food and water bowls. Locate it away from the litter box.   ",
    "text4": "4- Cats love to get away from it all in small places. If she came home in a cat carrier, you can use that.  You can also make one by cutting a doorway in the end of a cardboard box, or simply buy a covered  cat bed at a pet supply store. Whatever you choose, make sure the space is big enough for the cat to  stand up and turn around in. Make sure she can see the door to the room, so she won’t be startled. ",

    "text5": "Now you’re ready for your cat’s homecoming. Bring her home in a cat carrier, if possible. She’s seen a lot  of excitement, so take her directly to her new room (make sure the toilet lid is down, if she’s acclimating  in your bathroom). Ideally, you would restrict her exposure to the whole family, but naturally, everyone is  going to want to see her. Remind them of the ground rules you’ve set up.",
    "text6": "Sit on the floor and let her come to you. Don’t force her. Just let her get acquainted on her own  terms. If she doesn’t approach, leave her alone and try again later. Some cats are particularly  frightened, and she may retreat to her hidey hole and not come out when you’re around at all. She may only come out at night when the house is quiet. Give her time.",

    "text8": "As your cat adjusts, she’ll show signs that she wants to explore outside her safe‐haven. Make sure other pets or family memberswon’tstartle her while she gradually expands her territory. She may be ready to play, so you can furnish some toys. Many catslike feather wands from the pet supply store, but homemade toys are often favored. A wad of a tissue paper to bat around or a paper bag to hide in can be fun.  "

Because he will be under a lot of stress with the change of environment (from shelter or foster home to your house), he may forget any housebreaking (if any) he’s learned. Often a kitchen will work best for easy clean-up. ",

    "text3": "3-Training your dog will start the first moment you have him. Take time to create a vocabulary list everyone willuse when giving your dog directions. This will help prevent confusion and help your dog learn his commandsmore quickly. No matter the age or size of the dog, it is recommended that you begin with positive training classes within the first month after adoption. ",
    "text4": "4-Bring an ID tag with your phone number on it with you when you pick up your dog so that he has an extra measure of safety for the ride home and the first few uneasy days.

Limit visitors for the first week. We understand that youwant to show off your new dog and many want to meet your new family member but allow your dog some timeto become comfortable with the family and new home before introducing new people. Make sure children know    how to approach the dog without overwhelming him",
    "text6": "When you pick up your dog, remember to ask what and when he was fed. Replicate that schedule for at leastthe first few days to avoid gastric distress. If you wish to switch to a different brand, do so over a period ofabout a week by adding one part new food to three parts of the old for several days; then switch to half newfood, half old, and then one part old to three parts new.
